# Worklog

This log is append-oriented. Every task should record intent before changes and outcomes after changes.

## 2026-03-28 - Prompt 1 - Pre-Change

Intent:
Create the repository's mission-control and documentation spine without adding business logic.

Starting state:

- repository contains only `.git`
- no operating instructions or architecture documents exist yet

Planned commands:

```sh
make status
make docs-lint
make verify
git status --short --branch
```

Expected artifacts:

- repository operating instructions
- mission-control tracker, roadmap, worklog, and decision log
- starter ADR, invariants, risks, evidence, security, testing, and change-control documents

## 2026-03-28 - Prompt 1 - Post-Change

Outcome:
Created the repository's initial mission-control spine and kept the repo documentation-only.

Completed artifacts:

- root operating documents: `README.md`, `AGENTS.md`, `CONTRIBUTING.md`, `SECURITY.md`, `CODEOWNERS`, `.gitignore`, `Makefile`
- mission-control documents under `docs/mission-control/`
- starter ADR, invariants, risks, evidence, integration, domain, testing, security, runbook, and change-control documents
- prompt execution report in `docs/evidence/prompt-01-execution-report.md`

Commands run:

```sh
make docs-lint
make status
make verify
git status --short --branch
```

Results:

- `make docs-lint` passed
- `make status` reported Phase 0 and the expected untracked documentation tree before commit
- `make verify` passed and confirmed the repository remains documentation-only

Next step:
Pin the target Quickstart or LocalNet and document the first interface and dependency ADRs before adding business logic.

## 2026-03-28 - Proposal Alignment - Pre-Change

Intent:
Use the development-fund proposal as a stronger framing input for repository architecture, scope, milestones, and invariant planning.

Starting state:

- repository has a generic mission-control spine
- proposal introduces a concrete C-COPE framing, five-layer reference stack, milestone plan, and broader workflow scope

Planned commands:

```sh
make docs-lint
make status
make verify
git status --short --branch
```

Expected artifacts:

- updated repo framing and roadmap aligned to the proposal
- expanded invariant and integration documentation
- ADR and decision-log updates where the proposal changes repository-level architecture assumptions

## 2026-03-28 - Proposal Alignment - Post-Change

Outcome:
Aligned the repository docs to the 2026-03-28 development-fund proposal and made the C-COPE control-plane framing explicit without adding business logic.

Completed artifacts:

- proposal-aligned repository framing in `README.md` and `docs/mission-control/MASTER_TRACKER.md`
- milestone structure updated in `docs/mission-control/ROADMAP.md`
- new architectural ADR in `docs/adrs/0002-c-cope-solution-shape.md`
- expanded invariant, integration, glossary, testing, evidence, and risk documents
- decision log updated to reflect the adopted solution shape

Commands run:

```sh
make docs-lint
make status
make verify
git status --short --branch
```

Results:

- `make docs-lint` passed after the proposal-alignment updates
- `make status` continued to report `Current Phase: Phase 0 - Mission Control Spine`
- `make verify` passed and confirmed the repository remains documentation-only

Next step:
Translate the proposal's Milestone 1 into concrete repository artifacts: `CPL v0.1`, policy profiles, and the first dependency and interface ADRs.
